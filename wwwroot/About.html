    <h2 style="color:darkgreen">Howdy! I'm Cameron, an Aspiring software dev with Rocket Mortgage. Born and raised in Terre Haute, Indiana, I'm a recent addition to Michigan.<br />
    Most of my free time is spent with friends, playing video or board games, or listening to music to relax. I have two dogs, a husky aussie mix named Kona, and her brother Scout, who is a mutt.</h2>
